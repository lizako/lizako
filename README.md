- 👋 Hi, I’m @lizako, also known as Liza Kotlyarevskiy. I am a freshman at the College of Staten Island in New York City. I have been passionate about technology ever since I took a basic
- computing skills class in elementary school, having dabbled in HTML during middle school. In high school, my journey continued as I learned Java and decided to study Computer Science.
- In my free time, I mostly like to read and write (Andy Weir, anyone?).
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about every area of technology, especially full-stack software engineering, data analysis, and DevOps!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. This year, I am taking Calculus One and Intro to C++. In high school, my relevant coursework included Calculus AB and Computer Science Java. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for internships taking place either remotely or within the New York City area during the summer of 2024.
- 📫 How to reach me: lizamichellekotlyarevskiy@gmail.com
